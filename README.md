# Third_Year_Project

# This is part of the code used within my Third Year Project at the University Of Southampton. 
# This, combined with other elements, formed the basis of my dissertation, of which the IP belongs to the University 
# Of Southampton (as is default).

# The majority of the code stored here retrieves and processes the data available through the National Rail Open Data
# Feeds.

# This repository includes:
# - Set up of database required to hold data.
# - Scripts experimenting with the various data feeds (particularly the Open Data Feeds and Darwin Feed)
# - Python scripts to preprocess the data before machine learning takes place (data cleaning, sanitisation etc)
# - Python scripts using sk-learn among other libraries to experiment with various models and processes to learn from 
#     the data (note this takes place within the 'Preprocessing.py' script). This was the experimentation and training 
#     phase.
# - Python scripts denoting the final method used to manipulate the data to give a model and results.
# - Graphing scripts
